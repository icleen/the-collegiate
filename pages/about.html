            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
              This is a news site inspired by the old school newspapers
              of the 1800's.  Back during the early years of our nation
              newspapers didn't have huge staffs of reporters that went
              out gathering data and writing articles; much of the content
              was written by the educated people in the area.  Many of the
              names you know as founding fathers were well known because of
              the essays they submitted to those newspapers, including
              Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, etc.
              <br>
              <br>
              The goal of this site is to give students an opportunity to
              submit their own stories and articles.  Anyone who wants to
              write an their opinion on politics, or help spread the word
              about a crisis around the world, or share an experience they've
              had that could uplift others, should be able to do so.
              <br>
              <br>
              In addition, we also try our best to link to other articles
              done my major news organizations, such as NPR, FoxNews, CNN,
              and others.  On our politics page you will see that we have two
              columns, a blue column for Democratic influenced stories, and a
              red one for Republican led stories.

            <h2>How you can help</h2>
            <p>
              As we said above, we want you to participate in the democratic
              cycle, as well as the news cycle.  Submit your essays and opinions
              on our contacts link and we will try to publish them [note: we do
              review all articles before publishing to prevent harsh opinions of
              racism, sexism, foul language, etc.  See our standards for
              publishing linked at the bottom of this page.].
